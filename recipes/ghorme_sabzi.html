    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ghormeh Sabzi is a traditional Persian herb stew made with a flavorful mix of fresh herbs, tender chunks of meat,
        kidney beans, and dried limes. This iconic Iranian dish is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in a tangy,
        aromatic, and deeply satisfying meal. It's typically served with steamed basmati rice, making it a staple of
        Persian cuisine and a favorite at family gatherings and celebrations.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>For the Stew:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef or lamb, cut into small chunks (1 pound / 450g)</li>
        <li>Kidney beans, soaked overnight (1 cup / 200g)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, finely chopped (1 cup / 50g)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, finely chopped (1/2 cup / 25g)</li>
        <li>Fresh fenugreek leaves or dried fenugreek (2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Spinach, finely chopped (optional, 1/2 cup / 25g)</li>
        <li>Onion, finely chopped (1 medium)</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced (3 cloves)</li>
        <li>Dried limes (3-4, pierced with a fork)</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Water (4-5 cups / 1-1.2 liters)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For Serving:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Steamed basmati rice</li>
        <li>Saffron (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and
            sauté until golden and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chunks of meat to the pot. Sprinkle with turmeric, salt, and black pepper. Sear the meat until
            browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil and sauté the parsley, cilantro, fenugreek, and spinach (if
            using) until aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add this herb mixture to the pot with the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked kidney beans and pierced dried limes to the pot. Pour in the water, ensuring everything is
            submerged.</li>
        <li>Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Simmer for 2-3 hours, stirring
            occasionally, until the meat is tender and the flavors are well blended.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed. Remove the dried limes before serving, or leave
            them in for a more intense flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve the Ghormeh Sabzi hot, alongside steamed basmati rice. Garnish with a pinch of saffron if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
