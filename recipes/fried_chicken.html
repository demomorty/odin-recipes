  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <h4>For the Chicken:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, wings, etc.) - 2 pounds / 900g</li>
    <li>Buttermilk (2 cups / 480ml)</li>
    <li>Salt (1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Black pepper (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>For the Coating:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour (2 cups / 250g)</li>
    <li>Cornstarch (1/4 cup / 30g)</li>
    <li>Garlic powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Onion powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Paprika (1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Cayenne pepper (optional, 1/4 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Baking powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Salt (1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>Black pepper (1/2 teaspoon)</li>

  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, buttermilk, salt, and black pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for best results.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, baking powder, salt, and black pepper to create the coating.</li>
    <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and let any excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, pressing firmly to ensure a thick, even coating.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large, heavy pot to 350째F (175째C). Ensure there is enough oil to fully submerge the chicken pieces.</li>
    <li>Carefully place a few pieces of chicken in the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and fully cooked (internal temperature of 165째F / 74째C).</li>
    <li>Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Serve hot with your favorite sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits.</li>
  </ol>
