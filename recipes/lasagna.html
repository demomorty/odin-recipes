        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese (2 cups / 200g)</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and pork, and cook until browned,
            breaking it into small pieces.</li>
          <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté until softened and fragrant, about 3
            minutes.</li>
          <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Add sugar, dried basil, oregano,
            salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
          <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, the egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until
            well blended and set aside.</li>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If not using oven-ready lasagna noodles, cook them until al dente
            according to package instructions. Drain and lay flat to avoid sticking.</li>
          <li>Spread 1 cup of the prepared meat sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
          <li>Lay 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on
            top, followed by 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese, and then 1 cup of meat sauce.</li>
          <li>Repeat the layering process (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, and sauce) two more times, finishing with meat
            sauce as the top layer.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese evenly over the top.</li>
          <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (sprayed with non-stick spray to prevent sticking). Bake for 25 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
