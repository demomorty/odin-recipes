This project is part of my practice while following [**the Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) tutorial, a fantastic resource for learning web development. I really appreciate the Odin Project because it’s more like a meta-course—it doesn’t try to write everything itself from start to finish. Instead, it provides links to well-established learning materials across the internet, offering a curated, distributed approach to learning. And well, the Odin Project is an open-source project itself.
So far, I’ve gained a basic understanding of Git and started exploring HTML. This project is my first hands-on assignment in the course, focusing specifically on HTML fundamentals. It’s an exciting opportunity to put theory into practice, and I’m looking forward to building on this foundation as I progress through the curriculum.
